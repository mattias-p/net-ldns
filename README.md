Zonemaster LDNS
===============

## Introduction

This module provides a Perl interface to the [ldns library](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/) from [NLnet Labs](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/). This module includes the necessary C code from ldns, so the library does not need to be globally installed. It does, however, rely on a sufficiently recent version of OpenSSL being present.

This module is written as part of the [Zonemaster project](http://github.com/dotse/zonemaster), and therefore primarily exposes the functionality needed for that. Since Zonemaster is a diagnostic tool, that means the functions most used are those for looking things up and inspecting them.

If you want a module that specifically aims to be a complete and transparent interface to ldns, [DNS::LDNS](http://search.cpan.org/~erikoest/DNS-LDNS/) is a better fit than this module.

Initially this module was named Net::LDNS.

## Recommended installation

The recommended way to install Zonemaster::LDNS is to install it from CPAN as a dependency to Zonemaster::Engine. If you follow the [installation instructions for Zonemaster::Engine](https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-engine/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) you will get all the prerequisites for Zonemaster::LDNS before installing it from CPAN.

For installation from from source, see below.

## Optional features

When installing from source, you can choose to enable or disable a number
of optional features using command line options to the `perl Makefile.PL`
commands.

### IDN

Enabled by default.
Disable with `--no-idn`.

If the IDN feature is enabled, the GNU `libidn` library will be used to
add a simple function that converts strings from Perl's internal encoding
to IDNA domain name format.
In order to convert strings from whatever encoding you have to Perl's
internal format, use L<Encode>.
If you need any kind of control or options, use L<Net::LibIDN>.
The included function here is only meant to assist in the most basic case,
although that should cover a lot of real-world use cases.

> **Note:** The Zonemaster Engine test suite assumes this feature
> is enabled.

### Internal ldns

Enabled by default.
Disable with `--no-internal-ldns`.

When enabled, an included version of ldns is statically linked into
Zonemaster::LDNS.
When disabled, libldns is dynamically linked just like other dependencies.

### Randomized capitalization

Disabled by default.
Enable with `--randomize`.

> **Note:** This feature is experimental.

Randomizes the capitalization of returned domain names.


## Dependencies

Run-time dependencies:
 * `openssl`
 * `libidn` (if [IDN] is enabled)
 * `libldns` (if [Internal ldns] is disabled)

Compile-time dependencies (only when installing from source):
 * `make`
 * `Devel::CheckLib`
 * `git` (if [Internal ldns] is enabled)
 * `libtool` (if [Internal ldns] is enabled)
 * `autoconf` (if [Internal ldns] is enabled)
 * `automake` (if [Internal ldns] is enabled)

Test-time dependencies:
 * `Test::Fatal`


## Installation from source

Override the default set of features by appending `--FEATURE` and/or
`--no-FEATURE` options to the `perl Makefile.PL` command.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-ldns
cd zonemaster-ldns
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

> **Note:** The source ZIP files downloaded from Github are broken with
> respect to this instruction.


## Post-installation sanity check

```sh
perl -MZonemaster::LDNS -E 'say Zonemaster::LDNS->new("8.8.8.8")->query("zonemaster.net")->string'
```

The above command should print some `dig`-like output.


## Testing

Some of the unit tests depend on data on Internet, which may change. To avoid false 
fails, those unit tests are only run if the environment variable `TEST_WITH_NETWORK` is `true`. By default that variable
is unset (those tests are not run). To run all tests, execute

```sh
TEST_WITH_NETWORK=1 make test
```


## Compatibility

There is a small part in the code that may not be compatible with non-Unix operating systems, in that it assumes that the file /dev/null exists.


[IDN]: #idn
[Internal ldns]: #internal-ldns
